# Real-Time Emotion Detection Using OpenCV & DeepFace
Developed a real-time emotion detection system using OpenCV and DeepFace. It captures webcam footage, analyzes facial expressions, and detects emotions like happiness, sadness, and anger. The detected emotion is displayed on the video feed. Runs until 'q' is pressed. Can be used for sentiment analysis and AI-driven applications.
